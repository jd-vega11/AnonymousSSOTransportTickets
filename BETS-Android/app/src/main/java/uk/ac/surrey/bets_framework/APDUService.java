   * thread where UI operations take place for Activities running in the
   * same process.  You should always avoid stalling the main
   * thread's event loop.  When doing long-running operations,
   * network calls, or heavy disk I/O, you should kick off a new

   *                0, {@link #START_FLAG_REDELIVERY}, or {@link #START_FLAG_RETRY}.
